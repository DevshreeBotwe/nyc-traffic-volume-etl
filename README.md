This project is a one-script pipeline for NYC traffic counts. It downloads data from NYC Open Dataâ€™s API, cleans it (clear names, correct types, timestamp), and saves both raw and clean CSVs plus a SQLite database. It then analyzes the data to find the top 10 busiest road segments and monthly totals by borough, exporting results to the output folder.
